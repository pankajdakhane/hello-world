Through my career, I have enjoyed being in customer facing roles, helping them solve their business and technical problems. Hands on leadership has been my style while working on several projects where I worked in a capacity of Technical Lead. I have 6+ years of experience of working on client sites majorly in Europe in countries like the UK and Denmark. I have a passion for singing and love to participate in events whenever I can.
